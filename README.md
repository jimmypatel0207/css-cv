CSS README
This README provides an overview of the CSS files in this project and instructions on how to use them.

Files
The CSS files in this project are located in the css/ directory. There are two main files:

styles.css: This is the main CSS file that contains styles for the entire website. It includes styles for typography, layout, and components.
normalize.css: This is a CSS file that normalizes the styles of HTML elements across different web browsers.
Usage
To use the CSS files in your project, follow these steps:

Copy the css/ directory and its contents to your project directory.

Link the CSS files in your HTML file by adding the following code to the <head> section:

html
Copy code
<link rel="stylesheet" href="css/normalize.css">
<link rel="stylesheet" href="css/styles.css">
Note: Make sure to adjust the file paths if the css/ directory is located in a different location in your project.

Customize the styles in the styles.css file to match your website's design.

Contributing
If you would like to contribute to the CSS in this project, please follow these guidelines:

Use semantic class names that describe the purpose of the element.
Use consistent indentation and formatting.
Write comments to explain complex or tricky parts of the code.
Test your changes on different web browsers and devices to ensure compatibility.

CSS Methodologies
CSS methodologies are sets of guidelines and best practices for writing CSS code that is scalable, maintainable, and easy to understand. Some popular CSS methodologies include:

BEM (Block-Element-Modifier): BEM is a naming convention that uses descriptive class names to define blocks, elements, and modifiers of a component. It helps to create independent and reusable components.
SMACSS (Scalable and Modular Architecture for CSS): SMACSS is a style guide that divides styles into five categories: base, layout, module, state, and theme. It aims to make CSS more maintainable, flexible, and scalable.
OOCSS (Object-Oriented CSS): OOCSS is a design pattern that separates structure and skin from the content and function of a component. It helps to create reusable and composable styles.
CSS Preprocessors
CSS preprocessors are programming languages that extend CSS with features like variables, nesting, functions, and mixins. They help to write CSS code faster, more efficiently, and with less repetition. Some popular CSS preprocessors include:

Sass (Syntactically Awesome Style Sheets): Sass is a mature and widely used preprocessor that uses a syntax similar to CSS but with additional features like variables, nesting, mixins, and inheritance.
Less (Leaner Style Sheets): Less is a lightweight preprocessor that also uses a syntax similar to CSS but with additional features like variables, nesting, mixins, and functions.
Stylus: Stylus is a flexible and expressive preprocessor that uses a more concise and customizable syntax than CSS.
CSS Frameworks
CSS frameworks are prebuilt sets of CSS code that provide a basic structure and style for web pages and applications. They help to save time and effort by providing a consistent and responsive design. Some popular CSS frameworks include:

Bootstrap: Bootstrap is a widely used framework that provides a responsive grid system, CSS components, JavaScript plugins, and utility classes for common tasks.
Foundation: Foundation is a flexible framework that provides a responsive grid system, CSS components, JavaScript plugins, and utility classes for building websites and applications.
Materialize: Materialize is a modern framework that provides a responsive design, CSS components, JavaScript plugins, and animations based on Google's Material Design guidelines.
